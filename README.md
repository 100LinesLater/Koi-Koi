## Koi-Koi

## Background & Overview

Hanafuda is a Japanese card game that can be played casually or with gambling rules. The game was developed during a time when the Japanese government was against gambling card games, thus a pictoral matching game was created as a way to try to appeal to the masses. The game become immensely popular and has become ingrained into Japanese culture. 

There are a few variations to the game, most notably Koi Koi, which translates to "come on" - indicating to continue the game. In this version players may decide to keep the hand going to try to earn more points. Should the opponent score before the player scores again, the opponent will score double points and the round will end. 

Users of this game will be able to play Koi Koi against a single computer player in a first to 100 points game.
